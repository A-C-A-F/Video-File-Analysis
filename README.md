# Video-File-Analysis
Video Analysis Using OpenCV and NumPy

In this project, we are going to demonstrate the basics of reading, analyzing, and writing video using Python, NumPy and OpenCV. The video file is a trimmed copy from an extraordinary 16mm silent home movie that shows a U.S. military officer's visit to the war-torn Philippines. The video file is in the public domain, so we are free to download and manipulate it. See this **[link](https://archive.org/details/57674TripToManilaMos)**.

### Below are the key objectives of this project:
__1. Understanding Video Processing:__ Learn how to use OpenCV and NumPy to read, manipulate, and process video frames. Gain insights into various video analysis techniques, such as pixel examination, brightness adjustment, color manipulation, and drawing shapes on video frames.

__2. Implementing Video Visualization:__ Explore methods to display and visualize video frames effectively. Learn to superimpose text, graphics, and shapes on video frames to convey important information or create visual effects. Understand how to generate a collage from video frames for creative presentation.

__3. Video File Manipulation:__ Gain practical experience in handling video files, such as reading and writing videos using OpenCV's VideoCapture and VideoWriter classes. Learn about the FourCC codes and different video codecs used in video file handling and understand the importance of frame rates and frame sizes when saving video output.
